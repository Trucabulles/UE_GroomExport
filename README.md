Put this under your project in a Plugins folder and compile it for your version of UE (you can start a new C++ project and just click "yes" when asked if you want to recompile the groom exporter). Tested in 5.3.2 and 5.4.1. After the plugin has been compiled youc an also use it in your engine plugin folder (fot the version you've compiled it).
